# 🌸 KNN Classification – Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates how to build a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier using the Iris dataset.

## 🎯 Objective

- Implement KNN for multi-class classification
- Tune the value of K
- Evaluate performance using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Visualize decision boundaries using the first two features

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- Instance-based learning
- Euclidean distance & neighbor voting
- Effect of different K values
- Model evaluation techniques

## 📁 Dataset

- **File**: `iris.csv`
- **Format**: Last column = target (species), others = features

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Make sure `iris.csv` is in the same directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
